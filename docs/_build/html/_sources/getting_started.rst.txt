Getting Started with PARROT
===========================

Installation
------------

PARROT is available through GitHub or the Python Package Index (PyPI). To install through PyPI, run

.. code-block:: bash

	$ pip install idptools-parrot

To clone the GitHub repository and gain the ability to modify a local copy of the code, run

.. code-block:: bash

	$ git clone https://github.com/idptools/parrot.git
	$ cd parrot
	$ pip install .

This will install PARROT locally. If you modify the source code in the local repository, be sure to reinstall with pip.
